# BootcampBooster
This application was designed with the intention of helping University of Toronto SCS and Trilogy Bootcamp students manage their learning.

One of the most helpful aspects of the application is that a student can use it to build their own database of coding skills with references to bootcamp week's number and activities in which it is presented.  There is a search function in GitLab that does point to the activity where a new concept is being introduced.  However, this application helps to make a more, specific and personalized note that allows the student to break down the skillset into as small units as needed.
